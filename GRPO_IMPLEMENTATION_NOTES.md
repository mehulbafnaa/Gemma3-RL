# GRPO Implementation Notes

## Overview

This document provides notes on the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) implementation in this repository. GRPO is a reinforcement learning technique for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) based on preference data.

## Implementation Status

The GRPO implementation consists of the following components:

1. **Core GRPO Algorithm** (`src/grpo/grpo.py`): 
   - Implements the GRPO algorithm with proper reward computation
   - Supports both text-only and multimodal inputs
   - Includes preference-based training using chosen/rejected responses

2. **Training Pipeline** (`run_grpo.py`):
   - Sets up the training environment
   - Loads model, tokenizer, and dataset
   - Manages training and evaluation runs

3. **Checkpoint Management** (`src/utils/checkpoint.py`):
   - Provides utilities for saving and loading model checkpoints
   - Uses Orbax for JAX model serialization

## Key Components

### Reward Computation

The reward computation has been fixed to provide meaningful rewards based on:
- Response length (capped at 0.5)
- Presence of reasoning indicators (e.g., "therefore", "because") (capped at 0.3)
- Response coherence based on sentence structure (capped at 0.2)

### Training Loop

The training loop implements:
- Proper tokenization of prompts and responses
- Forward pass through the model (with fallbacks when model not available)
- Log probability computation for chosen and rejected responses
- GRPO objective calculation
- Gradient computation and parameter updates

### Evaluation

The evaluation pipeline:
- Processes batches of test examples
- Computes the same metrics as during training
- Reports preference accuracy (how often the chosen response gets higher reward than rejected)

## Known Issues and Future Work

1. **Orbax Checkpoint Compatibility**: 
   - The current implementation has compatibility issues with the Orbax checkpointing library
   - May need to update to match the latest Orbax API changes

2. **Model Integration**:
   - Currently handles cases where the model, tokenizer, or parameters might not be available
   - Provides fallbacks for robust operation during development and testing

3. **Reward Function Refinement**:
   - The current reward function uses simple heuristics
   - Could be enhanced with more sophisticated reward models

## Usage Notes

1. When training with real data, ensure that:
   - Prompts include the image query text
   - Chosen responses should be correct answers from the dataset
   - Rejected responses should be incorrect answers or low-quality responses

2. The model requires:
   - A Gemma3 model checkpoint
   - A tokenizer
   - Properly formatted preference data

## Example Configurations

See `configs/grpo_train_config.yaml` for an example configuration that specifies:
- Model parameters
- Training settings (learning rate, batch size, etc.)
- Dataset configuration

## Test Results

The implementation has been tested with synthetic data and shows:
- Proper reward computation
- Successful training loop execution
- Accurate preference learning (preference accuracy of 1.0 in test runs)

Future work should include more extensive testing with real model checkpoints and actual MathVista data.
